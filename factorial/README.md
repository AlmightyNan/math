# Math - Factorial
- Using python to print the factorial of integer n according to user's input.

# Usage
- ```python main.py```

# Working
This program calculates the factorial of a number that the user enters.

To calculate the factorial of the input number, the program defines a function called `factorial` that uses recursion. If the input number is 0, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate the factorial of the input number by multiplying the input number by the factorial of the number minus 1.

The program then prompts the user to enter a number. After the user enters the number, the program calls the `factorial` function with the entered number as an argument and prints the result as output.
