# Math - Fibonacci's Series
- Using python to print fibonacci's series about the Nth integer.

# Usage
- ```python main.py```

# Working
This program generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number that is entered by the user.

When the user enters a number, the program first defines a function called fibonacci that uses recursion to calculate and return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function checks if the input value is 0 or 1, and returns 0 or 1 respectively. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the two preceding numbers.

After defining the function, the program prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 0 up to the specified number. For each number in the range, it calls the `fibonacci` function to calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number and print it out. Finally, the program displays the entire Fibonacci series up to the entered number as output.
